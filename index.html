									<h2>Natural Selection Simulation </h2>
									<h3>Roles: Team Lead / Lead AI Designer / Gameplay Designer</h3>
									<h3>Tools: Unity Engine, C#, Github, Itch.io, CI/CD</h3>
									<h3>Description:</h3>
									<p>This project is an advanced Artificial Intelligence simulation that has multiple species of animals interacting in a
										procedurally-generated environment. The traits of these animals can be configured by the player such that they can see the effects
										of various decisions such as size, fur color, speed, among other traits. Once the simulation begins, players will be able to
										watch as the ecosystem survives, thrives, or dies due to the choices in species design.
									</p>
									<p>
										Lastly, this project was accompanied by a host of SWE best practices such as Static Code Analysis, Linting,
										native Testing systems, Code Coverage, and an end-to-end Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline structure off of
										Github Actions custom written for this project.
